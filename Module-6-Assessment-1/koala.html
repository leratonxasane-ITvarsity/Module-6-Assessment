                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
                            <p>The  koala  or, inaccurately,  koala bear  (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an  arboreal  herbivorous marsupial  native to Australia. It is the only  extant  representative of the family  Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the  wombats, which are members of the family  Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland,  New South Wales,  Victoria, and  South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round,  fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb).(Wikipedia)</p>
                           <p>The koala is a stocky animal with a large head and  vestigial  or non-existent tail.[28][29]  It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and a weight of 4–15 kg (9–33 lb),[29]  making it among the largest arboreal marsupials.</p>
                           <p>Koalas are  herbivorous, and while most of their diet consists of eucalypt leaves, they can be found in trees of other genera, such as  Acacia,  Allocasuarina,  Callitris,  Leptospermum, and Melaleuca.[55]  (Wikipedia)</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                           <p>You will find the Koala at pen E32, directly opposite the lions den.</p>
