                            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                            <p>There is no denying that warthogs are not the most aesthetically pleasing of Africa’s wildlife. Large, flat heads covered in ‘warts’, four sharp tusks, sparse hair – they are not likely to win any beauty contests. However, there is a toughness and tenacity to these little animals that we cannot help but admire.They do have some odd habits – entering burrows backwards, trotting with erect tails, and bending their forelegs to graze – but their undeniable charisma will leave a memorable mark on your safari.</p>
                            <p>The large tusks of a warthog are actually enlarged canine teeth. They have to pairs – the shorter, lower pair and the longer, upper pair. The upper pair of tusks can grow up to 25cm in length! Warthogs use their tusks for digging, fighting rival warthogs and defending themselves from predators. Warthogs are known for using empty dens left by aardvarks. They use these dens to have their young. They also use them as hiding spots from predators. Warthogs go for flight over fight and will often back into their den, using their tusks to guard the entrance.</p>
                            <p>Warthogs may appear to be ferocious little animals, and contrary to Pumba the warthog eating worms in the Lion King, they are not carnivores. Warthogs are grazers, eating grasses, plants, berries and bark. They also use their snouts to dig up roots and bulbs.</p>
                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the lions at pen E20a, opposite the giraffe.</p>
